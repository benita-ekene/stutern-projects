      <h1 class="h1-tech-love">BENITA EKENE-OKIKERE's LOVE FOR TECHNOLOGY</h1>
      <div class="tech-love">
        <p><b>Benita Ojugo Ekene-Okikere</b> is  a Tech ethusiast. With a desire to understand more about the working of these computer systems, I was introduced to the world of programming  when I studied Computer Science at University level. During the course, I was exposed to core subjects such as Java, C, Network Security, Computer Communication Network, Wireless Communication and others. Amongst all, Java intrigued me the most because it exposes me to object oriented programming. My interest in this field grew exponentially, Practical sessions were always exciting especially the bugs that frustrates su much, as I was always enthusiastic in generating my own code and attain the desired output. They also helped me in understanding certain concepts. As technical skills and excellence cannot be achieved without excellent education, I would be able to realize my dreams of becoming a programmer when hone my skills and acquire my certificate as a Backend Developer.
        </p> 
        
        <p>career as a tech professional means you can work across a variety of industries and sectors.Therefore, computer and IT professionals are able to pursue opportunities in anything from entertainment and healthcare to finance and government, working for either a start-up or a well-established corporation â€“ or even a non-profit! The possibilities are endless High demand, high pay. As long as there are problems that require a solution within an industry, the skills held by a technology professional will always be an employable (and necessary) asset. Because of this, technology professionals can expect considerable compensation as their work is necessary, well-valued and difficult. To contribute my quoter in the world of technolgy as a backend developer, I took a bold step to join <b>STUTERN</b> Software Engineering !.4 Cohort as a <b>Backend Developer</b>. The program started fully on the 4th of October and since the it has been marathon learning, live sessions and assignments.

    <h2 class="h2-lessons">What I have Learnt so far</h2>
    <div class="tech-lessons">
      <p>
        The program started with "2 weeks home study pack" that includes: Development fundamentals, Development environment setup, introduction to HTML fundamentals, CSS fundamentals  and JavaScript fundamentals. Thereafter the live sessions began with practical examples of Git, Github, HtmL and Css classes. In the program I have learnt how to develop webpages using HTML5 and CSS. HTMLconsists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to order and display the content of the webpage, so it describes the structure of a Web page. HTML holds the content of the wepage while <b>CSS is very important in describing the style rules that we'd like to set for our HTML elements</b>. I learnt the three ways to include CSS in our web pages which are:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Inline styling. This is done by adding a style attribute to an HTML tag. We will see shortly that this can have some unintended consequences.</li>
          <li> < style >< /style >. This is done by using a style tag and placing CSS inside of it.</li>
          <li>External stylesheets. This is the most common way and almost always the best practice</li>
        </ol>

      <p><i>There various properties associated with CSS these include: CSS comments, CSS Colors, CSS images, CSS borders, CSS padding, CSS margin amongst others. CSS borders, CSS padding and CSS margin are very important in framing the webpages. It is important we know the difference between CSS borders, CSS padding and CSS margin.</i></p>
